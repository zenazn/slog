Slog
====

Structured logging for Go


Stability
---------

This package is a work in progress. I think it works, and it's pretty well
tested, but I'm still not sure I like either the API or the log format, and both
are liable to change.

I also owe the world a lot more documentation.

In any event, I encourage you to send me feedback, but I really wouldn't
recommend using slog just yet.
